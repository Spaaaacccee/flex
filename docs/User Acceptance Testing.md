The group must complete common tasks required in a team project.

The simulated project must be completed over three days and involves a list of subgoals, testing:

- Creating and managing a project.
- The ability to clearly communicate with each member what they are responsible for.
- Assigning people roles and tasks to do.
- Creating clear goals and deadlines.
- Sharing documents through Google Drive.
- Sharing documents through uploading files.
- Staying up-to-date with the progress of the project.

Users will fill out a Google Forms survey after the test, to evaluate user experience.
