# User Acceptance Testing

## 1 Procedure

The test involves the client, and a few collaborators (4).

The individuals as a group must complete common tasks required in a team project.

The tests will incorporate the following:

- Creating and inviting users to a project.

- The ability to clearly communicate with each member what they are responsible for.

- Assigning people roles and tasks to do.

- Creating clear goals and deadlines.

- Completing a goal.

- Sharing documents through Google Drive.

- Sharing documents through files.

- Updating documents.

- Staying up-to-date with the progress of the project.

Users will then complete a Google Forms survey after the test, to evaluate user experience. An average rating of 4/5 is considered a success.

A mock project will be used, detailed as follows:

### 2.2 Review of Test Results

Though not all of the procedure was followed exactly, all tests were considered highly successful, since all transactions were completed meaningfully nevertheless.

- Instead of using the two audio files to test the file versioning and deletion functionality, a participant completed the same test using a different set of files.

- Discussion for the alpha release date was omitted because the disussion for the beta release date already tested the same functionality.

- Deletion took place using another project with the same name because the client felt very attached to the newly created project.

A post-testing survey was used to evaluate user experience. On average, the test showed an average rating of 4.4/5, which is above the acceptable score of 4/5.

### 2.3 Corrective Action

All tests were completed successfully.  

The post-testing survey indicated that the weakest aspect of the app is its ability to keep users on track, scoring an average of 4/5. Perhaps this can be improved upon by:

- Maintaining an always-visible, personalised sidebar of upcoming events and tasks.

- Introducing a percentage progress feature for events, rather than a completed/uncompleted status.

- Introducing the ability to set an event to be completed upon a condition, for example a file submission.

- More detailed, or clearer history record.

However adding any of these features is not a priority, as the app is already working very well.
