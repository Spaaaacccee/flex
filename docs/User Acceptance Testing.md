# User Acceptance Testing

## 1 Procedure

The test involves the client, and a few collaborators (3).

The individuals as a group must complete common tasks required in a team project.

The tests will incorporate the following:

- Creating and inviting users to a project.
- The ability to clearly communicate with each member what they are responsible for.
- Assigning people roles and tasks to do.
- Creating clear goals and deadlines.
- Completing a goal.
- Sharing documents through Google Drive.
- Sharing documents through files.
- Updating documents.
- Staying up-to-date with the progress of the project.

Users will then complete a Google Forms survey after the test, to evaluate user experience.
