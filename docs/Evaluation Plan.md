# 3 Stage Evaluation Plan

## Stage 1

### Time Frame

Prior to client signing off on the finished software

### Strategy

- User acceptance testing, with the client and others.

- Post-user-acceptance-testing survey.

### Criterion

#### Efficiency

- **Were the users able to use the software without guidance?**

  The majority of users have used older versions of the software prior to the user acceptance testing, though not extensively. The users were able to navigate and use the features of the software without guidance. Users reported that the similarities to existing software, e.g. Discord, helped with their usage of this new software.

  Successfulness rating: 5/5

- **Was the software fast and responsive during use?**

  The interface was highly responsive and fluid and did not show any signs of client-side lag.

  However, internet connection was slow to a degree where some operations, like real-time chat, seemed laggy to use. Sometimes, messages may take over half a minute to appear. This is a known issue, as the superior WebSocket API appears to be blocked by the school's internet connection, causing the app to fallback to using POST and GET requests, the same issue does not appear when the app is used anywhere else.

  Successfulness rating: 4/5

- **Did the users find the software easy to understand and enjoyable to use?**

  Survey results indicated that overall, the software was easy, and enjoyable to use. On average, users rated the usability of the app 4.5/5.

  Successfulness rating: 4/5

#### Effectiveness

- **Does the software provide correct responses to inputted data?**

  All tests that were than produced expected results. No errors were found.

  Successfulness rating: 5/5

- **Was the software able to help users in the planning process?**
  
  The software was able to help users manage a project timeline. It provided a platform for discussion, planning of events and when they should occur. In the survey, the participants rated "The app helped the project planning process" on average 4.5 out of 5.

  Successfulness rating: 4/5

- **Was the software able to help users understand their role and keep them on track in the project?**

  In general, the app was able to provide clarity to the user's goals, as an individual and as a team. The ability to tag events to users and roles helps members understand what they should be doing. Notifications and the feed page allow the user to make sure they're on track as a member of a project. Survey results show that the app performed the worst in this aspect, with a score of 4/5, and one user rating it 3/5.  Although it was considered a pass, more can be done to improve the app in this aspect, see corrective action in [User Acceptance testing](User%20Acceptance%20Testing.md) for more information.

  Successfulness rating: 3/5

### Explanation

The client was given a mock project and associated tasks to complete with some other users. The client and users was able to complete all tasks successfully.

The client and other users were then given an online survey to feedback on their experience.

See above for details.

## Stage 2
